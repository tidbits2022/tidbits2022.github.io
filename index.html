    <h1>Welcome to Tidbits!</h1>
    <p>We are currently under a prototyping stage and hope to launch our alpha version of the app in May 2023. The alpha version will include our basic features / functionality such as the note sharing portal, app timer, and most importantly display our
        gamified theme across our platform!

        <p>The actual app and functionality is under development. Our key pages have been completed, and our backend using MongoDB has been set up. We are establishing final touches and experimental features such as implementing AI into our system. Nevertheless,
            this is the mockup innovated by our talented design team following various iterations!
